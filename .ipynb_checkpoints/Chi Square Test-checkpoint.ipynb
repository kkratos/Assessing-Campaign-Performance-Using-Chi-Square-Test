    "The client knows that customers who were contacted, signed up for the Delivery Club at a far higher rate than the control group, but now want to understand if there is a significant difference in signup rate between the cheap mailer and the expensive mailer.

    "## A/B Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "An A/B Test can be described as a randomised experiment containing two groups, A & B, that receive different experiences. Within an A/B Test, we look to understand and measure the response of each group - and the information from this helps drive future business decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Application of A/B testing can range from testing different online ad strategies, different email subject lines when contacting customers, or testing the effect of mailing customers a coupon, vs a control group.  Companies like Amazon are running these tests in an almost never-ending cycle, testing new website features on randomised groups of customers...all with the aim of finding what works best so they can stay ahead of their competition.  Reportedly, Netflix will even test different images for the same movie or show, to different segments of their customer base to see if certain images pull more viewers in.\n",

    "## Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "A Hypothesis Test is used to assess the plausibility, or likelihood of an assumed viewpoint based on sample data - in other words, a it helps us assess whether a certain view we have about some data is likely to be true or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different scenarios we can run Hypothesis Tests on, and they all have slightly different techniques and formulas - however they all have some shared, fundamental steps & logic that underpin how they work.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Null Hypothesis**\n",
    "\n",
    "In any Hypothesis Test, we start with the Null Hypothesis. The Null Hypothesis is where we state our initial viewpoint, and in statistics, and specifically Hypothesis Testing, our initial viewpoint is always that the result is purely by chance or that there is no relationship or association between two outcomes or groups\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Alternate Hypothesis**\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of the Hypothesis Test is to look for evidence to support or reject the Null Hypothesis.  If we reject the Null Hypothesis, that would mean we’d be supporting the Alternate Hypothesis.  The Alternate Hypothesis is essentially the opposite viewpoint to the Null Hypothesis - that the result is *not* by chance, or that there *is* a relationship between two outcomes or groups\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Acceptance Criteria**\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Hypothesis Test, before we collect any data or run any numbers - we specify an Acceptance Criteria.  This is a p-value threshold at which we’ll decide to reject or support the null hypothesis.  It is essentially a line we draw in the sand saying \"if I was to run this test many many times, what proportion of those times would I want to see different results come out, in order to feel comfortable, or confident that my results are not just some unusual occurrence\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Conventionally, we set our Acceptance Criteria to 0.05 - but this does not have to be the case.  If we need to be more confident that something did not occur through chance alone, we could lower this value down to something much smaller, meaning that we only come to the conclusion that the outcome was special or rare if it’s extremely rare.\n",
    "\n",
    "So to summarise, in a Hypothesis Test, we test the Null Hypothesis using a p-value and then decide it’s fate based on the Acceptance Criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types Of Hypothesis Test**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different types of Hypothesis Tests, each of which is appropriate for use in differing scenarios - depending on a) the type of data that you’re looking to test and b) the question that you’re asking of that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of our task here, where we are looking to understand the difference in sign-up *rate* between two groups - we will utilise the Chi-Square Test For Independence.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Chi-Square Test For Independence\n",
    "\n",
    "The Chi-Square Test For Independence is a type of Hypothesis Test that assumes observed frequencies for categorical variables will match the expected frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *assumption* is the Null Hypothesis, which as discussed above is always the viewpoint that the two groups will be equal.  With the Chi-Square Test For Independence we look to calculate a statistic which, based on the specified Acceptance Criteria will mean we either reject or support this initial assumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *observed frequencies* are the true values that we’ve seen.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *expected frequencies* are essentially what we would *expect* to see based on all of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Another option when comparing \"rates\" is a test known as the *Z-Test For Proportions*.  While, we could absolutely use this test here, we have chosen the Chi-Square Test For Independence because:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The resulting test statistic for both tests will be the same\n",
    "* The Chi-Square Test can be represented using 2x2 tables of data - meaning it can be easier to explain to stakeholders\n",
    "* The Chi-Square Test can extend out to more than 2 groups - meaning the business can have one consistent approach to measuring signficance\n",
